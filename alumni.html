<h2>FULL STACK BATCH </h2>
<h3>Associate Software Engineer, TCS</h3>
<p>When I first entered  JITS I was anxious about my future. Over the Six Months, so many doors were opened for our personal and academic development that I became confident. The Institute aims at enhancing our knowledge, skills and abilities. It, in fact, didn’t leave the attitude part behind as well. The time at JITS is th best time concerning learning, experience and gaining exposure to fields relevant to my discipline, all due to my faculty member. At last, thanks to the Institute's Placement Department for their continuous efforts in getting me placed in top IT Company. This endeavor will lead our institute to incredible heights.</p>

<p>JITS is such an institution that not only inspire you but also teaches what your end goal is. Here lecture halls seemed filled with the spirit of wisdom & the Faculty were the embodiment of knowledge. Qualities like initiative and leadership appears in every student through the co curricular activities in Institute. In the end all I could muster up JITS is the part where you find who you are.</p></td>
